## primary_list
# Defines what list (either whitelist or blacklist) has the priority.
#
# For example: if 'blacklist' is set, the blacklist will overwrite
# the whitelist. It'll block the connection to a particular host from the
# blacklist even if it's allowed in the whitelist.
#
# Possible values: whitelist, blacklist
# Default value: blacklist

primary_list=blacklist


## use_partial_matching
# Defines whether the WHITELIST includes sub-domains or not.
#
# For example: You white listed the domain wholesome-ads.com, if the value
# is set to 'true' all it's sub-domains like annoying.wholesome-ads.com will be
# also allowed. To disable this set the value to 'false'.
#
# Note: if you set primary_list to blacklist you still can block it's
# specific sub-domains or top-level domain in the blacklist.
#
# Possible values: true, false
# Default value: true

use_partial_matching=true


## ignore_download_error
# If set to false, we'll only apply the hosts file if all hosts sources
# could be reached.
#
# For example: You have a few host sources but one is not responding, to not
# lose the already installed domains from the particular source, the script
# won't continue.
#
# Possible values: true, false
# Default value: true

ignore_download_error=true


## http_proxy_address, https_proxy_address ##
# Specify what proxy server should be used when fetching the host domains.
# This will set or overwrite the environment variables of
# 'http_proxy' and 'https_proxy_address'.
#
# Possible value: address:port (e.g proxy:8080, 127.0.0.1:9050)
# Default value: Null (not set)

#http_proxy=proxy:8080
#https_proxy=proxy:8080

## hosts_file_path
# hosts_file_pat is used to set the path to the systems hosts file.
# Change if your system uses an other file or path.
#
# Default value: /etc/hosts

hosts_file_path=/etc/hosts


## hosts_file_backup_path ##
# hosts_file_backup_path is used to set the filename and the path to the
# backup of the hosts file to be created by Adsorber in the install process.
# To simply create a new backup run 'adsorber.sh install'
#
# Default value: /etc/hosts.original

hosts_file_backup_path=/etc/hosts.original


## crontab_dir_path
# This defines the directory in which we'll set the crontab.
# Used to create a scheduler which supplies the hosts file regulary with
# new ad-domains.
#
# In the default setting it'll update once a week. You can change this behavior
# with setting another directory, for example /etc/cron/daily to update the
# hosts file daily.
#
# Possible value: /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly,
# /etc/cron.monthly, or any other directory which it's contents will be
# executed as a script regulary.
#
# Default value: /etc/cron.weekly

crontab_dir_path=/etc/cron.weekly


## systemd_dir_path
# This defines the directory in which we'll place the systemd files.
# Used to create a scheduler which supplies the hosts file regulary with
# new ad-domains. Change if your system has an other path.
#
# In the default setting it'll update once a week. To change this behavior you
# need to change adsorber.timer's 'OnCalendar' setting to another period.
# The file can be found at systemd_dir_path, to change it before placement go
# into the scripts root directory and edit bin/systemd/adsorber.timer
#
# Default value: /etc/systemd/system

systemd_dir_path=/etc/systemd/system
