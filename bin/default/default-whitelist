# Whitelist
# Use to allow domains, even if they are blocked from hosts sources.
# The blacklist overwrites the whitelist. This can be changed in adsorber.conf
#
# Note: the whitelist uses partial matching. Means if you allow adserver.tld
# all its subdomains like ad1.adserver.tld also will be allowed.
# (Can be changed in adsorber.conf by editing USE_PARTIAL_MATCHING)
#
# Entries must begin with either 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0

#127.0.0.1 stablestud.org
#0.0.0.0 github.com
