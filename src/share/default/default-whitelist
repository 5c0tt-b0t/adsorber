# Whitelist
# Use to allow domains, even if they are blocked from some hosts sources.
# However the blacklist overwrites the whitelist by default. This can be changed in adsorber.conf.
#
# Note: the whitelist uses partial matching. Means if you allow adserver.tld,
# all its subdomains like ad1.adserver.tld also will be allowed.
# (Can be changed in adsorber.conf by changing 'use_partial_matching' to false)
#
# Entries must begin with either 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0

#127.0.0.1 stablestud.org
#0.0.0.0 github.com
